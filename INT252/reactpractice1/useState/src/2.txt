//local storage -
Local Storage is used in React to store data in the browser permanently, so it doesn’t disappear on page refresh or browser close.

Let’s break it down clearly 👇

🔹 What is Local Storage?

Local Storage is a Web Storage API provided by the browser.

Stores data as key–value pairs

Data is stored as strings

Persists even after refresh or browser restart

Storage limit ≈ 5–10 MB

👉 React does not provide localStorage — it’s a browser feature that React apps often use


//code:-
import React from 'react'

const App = () => {
    const user={
        username:'sarthak',
        age:18,
        city:'Bhopal'
    }
    localStorage.setItem('user',JSON.stringify(user))

    const user=JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'))
    console.log(user)
     
  return (
    <div>
    App
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
